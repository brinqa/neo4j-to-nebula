 * Causal chaining is carried out by passing bookmarks between transactions.

 * bookmarks.

 * <p>Within a session, bookmark propagation is carried out automatically. Thus all transactions in
 * a session (both managed and unmanaged) are guaranteed to be carried out one after another.
 *
 * <p>To opt out of this mechanism for unrelated units of work, applications can use multiple
