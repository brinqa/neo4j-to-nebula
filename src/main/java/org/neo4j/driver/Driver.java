/**
 * Accessor for a specific Neo4j graph database.
 *
 * <p>Driver implementations are typically thread-safe, act as a template for session creation and
 * host a connection pool. All configuration and authentication settings are held immutably by the
 * Driver. Should different settings be required, a new Driver instance should be created.
 *
 * <p>A driver maintains a connection pool for each remote Neo4j server. Therefore the most
 * efficient way to make use of a Driver is to use the same instance across the application.
 *
 * <p>To construct a new Driver, use one of the {@link GraphDatabase#driver(String, AuthToken)
 * GraphDatabase.driver} methods. The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">URI</a> passed
 * to this method determines the type of Driver created. <br>
