/**
 * Common interface for components that can execute Neo4j queries.
 *
 * <h2>Important notes on semantics</h2>
 *
 * <p>queries run in the same {@link QueryRunner} are guaranteed to execute in order, meaning
 * changes made by one query will be seen by all subsequent queries in the same {@link QueryRunner}.
 *
 * <p>However, to allow handling very large results, and to improve performance, result streams are
 * retrieved lazily from the network. This means that when any of {@link #run(Query)} methods return
 * a result, the query has only started executing - it may not have completed yet. Most of the time,
 * you will not notice this, because the driver automatically waits for queries to complete at
 * specific points to fulfill its contracts.
 *
 * <p>Specifically, the driver will ensure all outstanding queries are completed whenever you:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Read from or discard a result, for instance via {@link Result#next()} or {@link
 *       Result#consume()}
 *   <li>Explicitly commit/rollback a transaction using blocking {@link Transaction#close()}
 *   <li>Close a session using blocking {@link Session#close()}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>As noted, most of the time, you will not need to consider this - your writes will always be
 * durably stored as long as you either use the results, explicitly commit {@link Transaction
 * transactions} or close the session you used using {@link Session#close()}.
 *
 * <p>While these semantics introduce some complexity, it gives the driver the ability to handle
 * infinite result streams (like subscribing to events), significantly lowers the memory overhead
 * for your application and improves performance.

   * Run a query and return a result stream.

   * <p>This method takes a set of parameters that will be injected into the query by Neo4j. Using
   * parameters is highly encouraged, it helps avoid dangerous cypher injection attacks and improves
   * database performance as Neo4j can re-use query plans more often.
   *
   * <p>This particular method takes a {@link Value} as its input. This is useful if you want to
   * take a map-like value that you've gotten from a prior result and send it back as parameters.
   *
   * <p>If you are creating parameters programmatically, {@link #run(String, Map)} might be more
   * helpful, it converts your map to a {@link Value} for you.
