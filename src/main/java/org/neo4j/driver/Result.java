/**
 * The result of running a Cypher query, conceptually a stream of {@link Record records}.
 *
 * <p>The standard way of navigating through the result returned by the database is to {@link
 * #next() iterate} over it.
 *
 * <p>Results are valid until the next query is run or until the end of the current transaction,
 * whichever comes first. To keep a result around while further queries are run, or to use a result
 * outside the scope of the current transaction, see {@link #list()}.
 *
 * <h2>Important note on semantics</h2>
 *
 * In order to handle very large results, and to minimize memory overhead and maximize performance,
 * results are retrieved lazily. Please see {@link QueryRunner} for important details on the effects
 * of this.
 *
 * <p>The short version is that, if you want a hard guarantee that the underlying query has
 * completed, you need to either call {@link Resource#close()} on the {@link Transaction} or {@link
 * Session} that created this result, or you need to use the result.
 *
 * <p>Calling any method on this interface will guarantee that any write operation has completed on
 * the remote database.
