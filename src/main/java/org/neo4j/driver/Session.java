/**
 * Provides a context of work for database interactions.
 *
 * <p>A <em>Session</em> is a logical container for a causally chained series of {@linkplain
 * Transaction transactions}. Client applications typically work with <em>managed transactions</em>,
 * which come in two flavours: transaction functions and auto-commit transactions. Managed
 * transactions automatically handle the transaction boundaries (<code>BEGIN</code> and <code>COMMIT
 * </code>/<code>ROLLBACK</code>) and can also provide other supporting features; transaction
 * functions offer retry capabilities, for example.
 *
 * <p>Unmanaged transactions are also available but tend to be used by libraries or tooling that
 * require more fine-grained control.
 *
 * <p>Typically, a session will acquire a TCP connection from a connection pool in order to carry
 * out a transaction. Once the transaction has completed, and the entire result has been consumed,
 * this connection will be released back into the pool. One connection can therefore be adopted by
 * several sessions over its lifetime, although it will only be owned by one at a time. Client
 * applications should never need to deal directly with connection management.
 *
 * <p>Session implementations are not generally thread-safe. Therefore, multiple sessions should be
 * used when an application requires multiple concurrent threads of database work to be carried out.
 *
 * @since 1.0 (Removed async API to {@link AsyncSession} in 4.0)
