/**
 * Logical container for an atomic unit of work. A driver Transaction object corresponds to a server
 * transaction.
 *
 * <p>Transactions are typically wrapped in a try-with-resources block which ensures in case of any
 * error in try block, the transaction is automatically rolled back on close. Note that <code>
 * ROLLBACK</code> is the default action unless {@link #commit()} is called before closing.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try(Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction())
 * {
 *     tx.run("CREATE (a:Person {name: $name})", parameters("name", "Alice"));
 *     tx.commit();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Blocking calls are: {@link #commit()}, {@link #rollback()}, {@link #close()} and various
 * overloads of {@link #run(Query)}.
 *
 * @see Session#run
 * @see QueryRunner
