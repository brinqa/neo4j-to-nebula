/**
 * Asynchronous interface for components that can execute Neo4j queries.
 *
 * <h2>Important notes on semantics</h2>
 *
 * <p>Queries run in the same {@link AsyncQueryRunner} are guaranteed to execute in order, meaning
 * changes made by one query will be seen by all subsequent queries in the same {@link
 * AsyncQueryRunner}.
 *
 * <p>However, to allow handling very large results, and to improve performance, result streams are
 * retrieved lazily from the network. This means that when async {@link #runAsync(Query)} methods
 * return a result, the query has only started executing - it may not have completed yet. Most of
 * the time, you will not notice this, because the driver automatically waits for queries to
 * complete at specific points to fulfill its contracts.
 *
 * <p>Specifically, the driver will ensure all outstanding queries are completed whenever you:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Read from or discard a result, for instance via {@link ResultCursor#nextAsync()}, {@link
 *       ResultCursor#consumeAsync()}
 *   <li>Explicitly commit/rollback a transaction using {@link AsyncTransaction#commitAsync()},
 *       {@link AsyncTransaction#rollbackAsync()}
 *   <li>Close a session using {@link AsyncSession#closeAsync()}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>As noted, most of the time, you will not need to consider this - your writes will always be
 * durably stored as long as you either use the results, explicitly commit {@link AsyncTransaction
 * transactions} or close the session you used using {@link AsyncSession#closeAsync()}.
 *
 * <p>While these semantics introduce some complexity, it gives the driver the ability to handle
 * infinite result streams (like subscribing to events), significantly lowers the memory overhead
 * for your application and improves performance.
 *
 * <h2>Asynchronous API</h2>
 *
 * <p>All overloads of {@link #runAsync(Query)} execute queries in async fashion and return {@link
 * CompletionStage} of a new {@link ResultCursor}. Stage can be completed exceptionally when error
 * happens, e.g. connection can't be acquired from the pool.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> Returned stage can be completed by an IO thread which should never block.
 * Otherwise IO operations on this and potentially other network connections might deadlock. Please
 * do not chain blocking operations like {@link CompletableFuture#get()} on the returned stage.
 * Consider using asynchronous calls throughout the chain or offloading blocking operation to a
 * different {@link Executor}. This can be done using methods with "Async" suffix like {@link
 * CompletionStage#thenApplyAsync(Function)} or {@link CompletionStage#thenApplyAsync(Function,
 * Executor)}.
 *

 * @see AsyncTransaction

  /**
   * Run a query asynchronously and return a {@link CompletionStage} with a result cursor.
   *
   * <p>This method takes a set of parameters that will be injected into the query by Neo4j. Using
   * parameters is highly encouraged, it helps avoid dangerous cypher injection attacks and improves
   * database performance as Neo4j can re-use query plans more often.
   *
   * <p>This particular method takes a {@link Value} as its input. This is useful if you want to
   * take a map-like value that you've gotten from a prior result and send it back as parameters.
   *
   * <p>If you are creating parameters programmatically, {@link #runAsync(String, Map)} might be
   * more helpful, it converts your map to a {@link Value} for you.
   *
   * <h2>Example</h2>
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * CompletionStage<ResultCursor> cursorStage = session.runAsync(
   *             "MATCH (n) WHERE n.name = $myNameParam RETURN (n)",
   *             Values.parameters("myNameParam", "Bob"));
   * }</pre>
   *
   * It is not allowed to chain blocking operations on the returned {@link CompletionStage}. See
   * class javadoc for more information.
   *
   * @param query text of a Neo4j query
   * @param parameters input parameters, should be a map Value, see {@link
   *     Values#parameters(Object...)}.
