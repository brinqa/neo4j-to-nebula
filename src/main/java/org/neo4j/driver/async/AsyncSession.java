/**
 * Provides a context of work for database interactions.
 *
 * <p>An <em>AsyncSession</em> hosts a series of {@linkplain AsyncTransaction transactions} carried
 * out against a database. Within the database, all queries are carried out within a transaction.
 * Within application code, however, it is not always necessary to explicitly {@link
 * #beginTransactionAsync() begin a transaction}. If a query is {@link #runAsync} directly against a
 * {@link AsyncSession}, the server will automatically <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>COMMIT</code>
 * that query within its own transaction. This type of transaction is known as an <em>autocommit
 * transaction</em>.
 *
 * <p>Unmanaged transactions allow multiple queries to be committed as part of a single atomic
 * operation and can be rolled back if necessary. They can also be used to ensure <em>causal
 * consistency</em>, meaning that an application can run a series of queries on different members of
 * a cluster, while ensuring that each query sees the state of graph at least as up-to-date as the
 * graph seen by the previous query. For more on causal consistency, see the Neo4j clustering
 * manual.
 *
 * <p>Typically, a session will acquire a TCP connection to execute query or transaction. Such a
 * connection will be acquired from a connection pool and released back there when query result is
 * consumed or transaction is committed or rolled back. One connection can therefore be adopted by
 * many sessions, although by only one at a time. Application code should never need to deal
 * directly with connection management.
 *
 * <p>A session inherits its destination address and permissions from its underlying connection.
 * This means that for a single query/transaction one session may only ever target one machine
 * within a cluster and does not support re-authentication. To achieve otherwise requires creation
 * of a separate session.
 *
 * <p>Similarly, multiple sessions should be used when working with concurrency; session
 * implementations are not thread safe.
