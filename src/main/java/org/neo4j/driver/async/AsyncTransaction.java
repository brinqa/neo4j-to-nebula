 * Logical container for an atomic unit of work. A driver Transaction object corresponds to a server
 * transaction.
 *
 * <p>Transactions are typically obtained in a {@link CompletionStage} and all operations chain on
 * this stage. Explicit commit with {@link #commitAsync()} or rollback with {@link #rollbackAsync()}
 * is required. Without explicit commit/rollback corresponding transaction will remain open in the
 * database.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * session.beginTransactionAsync()
 *        .thenCompose(tx ->
 *               tx.runAsync("CREATE (a:Person {name: $name})", parameters("name", "Alice"))

 *                 .thenApply(ignore -> tx)
 *        ).thenCompose(Transaction::commitAsync);
