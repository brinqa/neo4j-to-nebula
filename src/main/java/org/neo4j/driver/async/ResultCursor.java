/**
 * The result of asynchronous execution of a Cypher query, conceptually an asynchronous stream of
 * {@link Record records}.
 *
 * <p>Result can be eagerly fetched in a list using {@link #listAsync()} or navigated lazily using
 * {@link #forEachAsync(Consumer)} or {@link #nextAsync()}.
 *
 * <p>Results are valid until the next query is run or until the end of the current transaction,
 * whichever comes first. To keep a result around while further queries are run, or to use a result
 * outside the scope of the current transaction, see {@link #listAsync()}.
 *
 * <h2>Important note on semantics</h2>
 *
 * <p>In order to handle very large results, and to minimize memory overhead and maximize
 * performance, results are retrieved lazily. Please see {@link AsyncQueryRunner} for important
 * details on the effects of this.
 *
 * <p>The short version is that, if you want a hard guarantee that the underlying query has
 * completed, you need to either call {@link AsyncTransaction#commitAsync()} on the {@link
 * AsyncTransaction transaction} or {@link AsyncSession#closeAsync()} on the {@link AsyncSession
 * session} that created this result, or you need to use the result.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> Every returned {@link CompletionStage} can be completed by an IO thread which
 * should never block. Otherwise IO operations on this and potentially other network connections
 * might deadlock. Please do not chain blocking operations like {@link CompletableFuture#get()} on
 * the returned stages. Consider using asynchronous calls throughout the chain or offloading
 * blocking operation to a different {@link Executor}. This can be done using methods with "Async"
 * suffix like {@link CompletionStage#thenApplyAsync(Function)} or {@link
 * CompletionStage#thenApplyAsync(Function, Executor)}.
