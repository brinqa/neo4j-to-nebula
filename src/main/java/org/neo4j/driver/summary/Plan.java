/**
 * This describes the plan that the database planner produced and used (or will use) to execute your
 * query. This can be extremely helpful in understanding what a query is doing, and how to optimize
 * it. For more details, see the Neo4j Manual.
 *
 * <p>The plan for the query is a tree of plans - each sub-tree containing zero or more child plans.
 * The query starts with the root plan. Each sub-plan is of a specific {@link #operatorType()
 * operator type}, which describes what that part of the plan does - for instance, perform an index
 * lookup or filter results. The Neo4j Manual contains a reference of the available operator types,
 * and these may differ across Neo4j versions.
 *
 * <p>For a simple view of a plan, the {@code toString} method will give a human-readable rendering
 * of the tree.
